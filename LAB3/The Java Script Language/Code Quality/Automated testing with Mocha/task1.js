// i dont know if you will notice it, but in this topic there was a comment

// To those who are finding this lesson a bit more challenging 
// I would like to say that sometimes it's good to be exposed to
//  more advanced topics while learning something new. Even if it 
//  doesn't make much sense it has an impact on the brain and it will 
//  make sense eventually when you come back to look at it in more detail.
