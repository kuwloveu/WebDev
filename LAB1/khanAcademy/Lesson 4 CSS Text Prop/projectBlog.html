        <p>Today I started my journey as a programmer. I learned about the basic structure of HTML. It's amazing how simple tags can create a whole webpage. I'm excited to learn more about CSS and making things look "fancy"!</p>

        <h6 class="post-date">Posted on January 30, 2026</h6>
        <p>In today's lesson, I practiced building <strong>dinner tables</strong> and learned some fun facts about <em>Kangaroos</em>. Did you know they use their tails as a balance? I also mastered the <code>&lt;th&gt;</code> tag for table headers. Coding is becoming more interesting every day!</p>
